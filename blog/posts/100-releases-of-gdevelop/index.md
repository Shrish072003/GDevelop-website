GDevelop 5 recently reached its 100th release. It's a great milestone, and looking back at the first versions of GDevelop, we're very proud of what was accomplished and we're even prouder of the community that is living around GDevelop!

<!-- end -->

To celebrate this, we're opening **this blog**, where we'll regularly post about *news around GDevelop*, new features and highlights about community games and creators.

# 2 new features thanks to Google Summer of Code students...

This summer, we had the pleasure to get contributions from 2 students for Google Summer of Code. **Nilay Majorwar** implemented a *command palette* and customizable shortcuts, giving a very nice productivity boost to power users. **Harsimran Singh Virk** implemented *dynamic 2d lights*, a perfect way to improve your game visual quality, create day/night effects and improve your game atmosphere.

👉 Try these features in the **[latest release of GDevelop](/download)**!

# ...and lots of other improvements

This 100th release comes with its usual bugfixes, but also:
* a new theme **Solarized Dark**, made by **[The Gem Dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZ4Ue8c94YLJDbGRafCI5Q)**,
* a **Peer to Peer communication** by **Arthuro555**, enabling simple multiplayer games to be created,
* a **new demo** by **Sleeper Games**, author of [Hyperspace Dogfights](https://store.steampowered.com/app/842170/Hyperspace_Dogfights/) (made with GDevelop, [get it on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/842170/Hyperspace_Dogfights/)!) and [Hyperspace Harvest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342560/Hyperspace_Harvest/) ([wishlist it on Steam too!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342560/Hyperspace_Harvest/)).

It's an opportunity to send our thanks to the contributors that make GDevelop better with each release ❤️

# Don't forget the live preview!

**Live preview** was recently added to GDevelop. It's a great feature to improve your productivity while using the editor. Whenever you launch a preview, do some changes in the editor, then click again on the icon to run the preview: it will be automatically updated with the latest changes, without **restarting your game**.

> Better, it works with the **network preview**. Run it to remotely test your game on your phone, tablet or even other computers, instantly seeing your changes!

# What's next?

The development of GDevelop is community driven and priorities depend on what is being asked by the community and what contributors can help on. We should soon see support for **Firebase**, a **Bitmap Text** allowing to use bitmap fonts... and also some other secret stuff, but it's a surprise 🤫

Vote or comment on the [public Trello roadmap](https://trello.com/b/qf0lM7k8/gdevelop-roadmap) to make the features you care about visible, and take part in the community on the [forum](https://forum.gdevelop-app.com/) and on [the GDevelop Discord](https://discord.gg/rjdYHvj).

Here's to the next 100 releases!
